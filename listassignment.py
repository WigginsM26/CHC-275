mean.py

to the calculate the mean of the list,
    1) add up all the values
    2) divide by how many things there are
   
what list function tells us how many things there are? len(<name of list>)

1) create a variable called sum = 0
2) do a for-loop over a list of numbers


nums = [46,92,10,98,57,12,77,99,31,19,62,41,81,40,56,97,74,13,85,16,69,32,36,27,2,24,25,71,20,4,45,84,37,86,91,75,55,67,60,1,21,100,44,70,9,94,29,26,90,82,11,66,17,47,38,42,3,43,95,6,89,87,51,28,63,23,65,22,5,61,64,58,39,30,50,72,14,59,48,76,18,53,49,96,15,34,7,78,93,83,68,79,80,33,88,35,8,73,54,52]

3) calculate the mean
4) print out the mean
